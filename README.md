# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### The famous Coursera [deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course taught by Andrew Ng and offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

This is my personal summary of the course. This course covers deep learning extensively and I would higly recommend it to anybody wanting to break into Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.
