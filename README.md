# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [The famous Coursera deep learning specialization course taught by Andrew Ng and offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is my personal summary of the course. This course covers deep learning extensively and I would higly recommend it to anybody wanting to break into Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

 ## Course 1: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/cisco-girl/Deep_Learning_Specialization_Coursera/tree/main/1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)
